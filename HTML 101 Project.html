    <p>
      I am taking this course because after I finished college and jumped into
      my chosen profession, I quickly saw that it wasn't what I expected and I
      simply wasn't happy with what I was doing. Having worked in technology
      before as a systems engineer and data integration specialist, I had some
      knowledge of coding, but it was very limited. I decided to dig into it
      more, and the more I did, the more I enjoyed it. I still have a long way
      to go and so much to learn, but I am very excited about this new journey
      and can't wait to see what the future holds.
